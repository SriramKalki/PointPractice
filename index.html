    <h2>Welcome to PointPractice! This was created to help with teaching-so you can point at text/images on your bitpaper better ;)</h2>
    <p>PointPractice uses finger tracking algorithms developed by MediaPipe. To get started, make sure you give permission for the website 
        <br>
        to use your camera! If the camera shown isn't the correct one, go to browser settings, search for "camera", and use the dropdown
        <br>
        to change the camera you are using! 
        <br>
        When you are done, try using your index finger (finger between the thumb and the middle) to point at the rectangle
        <br>
        so your fingertip is inside of it. Keep pointing at it. If the rectangle turns green, 
        <br> 
        that means you were pointing to the rectangle for a stable amount of time!
        <br>
        This is using Computer Vision/Mediapipe! Amazing? From here, you can press the 'z' key on your keyboard to
        <br>
        draw another random rectangle on the screen! If for some reason the camera doesn't detect your finger, try 
        <br>
        changing your lighting or manually press 'z'. <strong>Make sure only one hand is visible!</strong> For best results, 
        <br>
        point so the front of your hand is fully facing the camera, like <a href='https://i.postimg.cc/JzWx4cf7/image.png' target="_blank">this</a>
